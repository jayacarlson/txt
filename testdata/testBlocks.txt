Anything outside a config block is ignored.

Config block label must start the line

Care must be taken when using the same file for ConfigData and
ConfigBlock as the parser will get confused mixing delimiters

ConfigData can have an optional data delimiter, one of ',;:|/'
identified by placing it after the block label

Inside a ConfigData:
	Any lines starting with the '#' are stripped allowing commented text
	Whitespace around the text is stripped
	Empty lines are ignored / stripped

block1 <
block1 blah blah
blah blah blah
>

block2 <
block2 blah blah
blah blah blah
>

block3 <block3 blah blah
blah blah blah
>

unknownBlock <
unknownBlock blah blah
blah blah blax
